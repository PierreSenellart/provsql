Aggregation and Grouping
=========================

ProvSQL supports provenance tracking for ``GROUP BY`` queries and aggregate
functions :cite:`DBLP:conf/pods/AmsterdamerDT11`. The semantics follow a
*semimodule* model: aggregation is treated as a scalar multiplication of
provenance values.

GROUP BY Queries
-----------------

When a query includes a ``GROUP BY`` clause, each output group receives an
``agg`` gate in the provenance circuit. The children of this gate are the
provenance tokens of all input tuples that contributed to the group:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT dept, COUNT(*), provenance()
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY dept;

The resulting provenance token encodes *which* input tuples were combined
to produce each aggregate value.

SELECT DISTINCT
----------------

``SELECT DISTINCT`` is modelled as a ``GROUP BY`` on all selected columns.
Each distinct output row gets a provenance token that captures all the
duplicate source rows that were merged:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT DISTINCT dept, provenance()
    FROM employees;

Aggregate Functions
--------------------

The aggregate functions ``COUNT``, ``SUM``, ``MIN``, ``MAX``, and ``AVG``
are all supported over provenance-tracked tables.

Arithmetic on Aggregate Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arithmetic, explicit casts, window functions, and other expressions
(``COALESCE``, ``GREATEST``, etc.) on aggregate results are supported,
both in the same query and over subquery results:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT dept, COUNT(*) * 10 FROM employees GROUP BY dept;
    SELECT dept, SUM(salary) + 1000 FROM employees GROUP BY dept;
    SELECT dept, string_agg(name, ', ') || ' (team)' FROM employees GROUP BY dept;
    SELECT cnt::numeric FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM employees GROUP BY dept) t;
    SELECT dept, cnt, SUM(cnt) OVER () FROM (SELECT dept, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM employees GROUP BY dept) t;
    SELECT dept, COALESCE(cnt, 0) FROM (SELECT dept, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM employees GROUP BY dept) t;
    SELECT dept, GREATEST(cnt, 3) FROM (SELECT dept, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM employees GROUP BY dept) t;

When such an operation is performed, the aggregate result is cast from
its internal ``agg_token`` representation back to the original aggregate
return type (e.g., ``bigint`` for ``COUNT``, ``numeric`` for ``AVG``).
A warning is emitted to indicate that the provenance information is lost
in the conversion. The provenance of the aggregate group itself is still
tracked in the ``provsql`` column.

HAVING
------

Simple ``HAVING`` clauses are supported:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT dept, COUNT(*) AS n, provenance()
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY dept
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

Complex ``HAVING`` conditions that involve provenance-tracked aggregates
(e.g., a ``HAVING`` on the result of a computation over an aggregate)
are not fully supported and may produce incorrect results or an error.

Grouping Sets
--------------

`GROUPING SETS, CUBE, and ROLLUP
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUPING-SETS>`_
are not supported.
